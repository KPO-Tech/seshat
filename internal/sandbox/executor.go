	// Runtime selects a non-default OCI runtime (docker run --runtime=…),

	// container. A stronger isolation runtime like gVisor must already be
	// installed and registered with the Docker daemon separately (this is
	// an operator/host setup step, not something DockerExecutor can do) —

	// when an environment's container is created (docker run -p). Useful
	// for e.g. previewing a dev server an agent starts inside the sandbox.
	// Fixed for the lifetime of an environment — declared here rather than
	// per RunRequest because Docker only allows publishing ports at
	// container-creation time. The actual host-side ports are reported back
	// via RunResult.Endpoints on every call to that environment.
	PublishPorts []int

	// TrackFileChanges enables git-tracked snapshots of RunRequest.WorkDir
	// (the host directory bind-mounted into the environment) after every

	// audit/undo convenience feature, not a security property, and requires
	// git on the HOST (not inside the container). If true and git isn't
	// found on the host, Healthy(ctx) fails rather than silently tracking
	// nothing — same "don't silently downgrade a requested capability"
	// contract as Runtime.
	//
