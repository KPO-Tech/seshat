# Contributing to Seshat

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Branching strategy

```
main          production-ready, tagged releases only
  └── dev     stable integration branch — all feature work lands here first
        └── <type>/<slug>   your working branch, one per issue
```

- Branch off `dev`, not `main`.
- Never commit or push directly to `main`.
- Never commit or push directly to `dev`.
- All work must flow through PRs: `<type>/*` → `dev`, then `dev` → `main`.
- Name your branch `<type>/<short-slug>` where `<type>` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, or `ci`.
- Open PRs **targeting `dev`**. The only allowed PR into `main` is `dev` → `main`, opened by maintainers for final validation at milestone boundaries.
- Direct PRs from topic branches into `main` will be closed without merge.
- The **Gate CI check** must be green before any PR can be merged (Build + Test + Lint all pass).

If someone makes an exceptional direct push to `main`, recreate or realign
`dev` from `main` before continuing normal feature work. Do not stack new
feature branches on top of a diverged `dev`.

## Before you open a PR

- **Bug fix** — open an issue first to confirm the bug and discuss the fix approach.
- **New feature** — open an issue or discussion before writing code. Features need to align with the [project vision](./docs/vision/idea.md) and the [current roadmap](./docs/vision/roadmap.md).
- **Documentation** — PRs are welcome without prior discussion.
- **Refactor** — discuss first. We are conservative about structural changes that could introduce regressions.

## Development setup

### Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- `golangci-lint` for linting
- `protoc` + `protoc-gen-go` + `protoc-gen-go-grpc` if modifying the proto file (see [`docs/transports.md`](./docs/transports.md))

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EngineerProjects/seshat
cd seshat

# Install git pre-commit hooks (run once)
make hooks

# Build
make build

# Test
make test
make test-race
```

### Environment

Copy `.env.example` (if present) or set provider credentials directly:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

---

## Code conventions

### Go style

- Format with `gofmt` — enforced by the pre-commit hook and CI.
- Follow `go vet` — enforced by CI.
- Follow `golangci-lint` rules — see [`.golangci.yml`](./.golangci.yml) for the active linter set.
- No `fmt.Printf` in non-test code — use the structured logger in `internal/monitoring`.
- No global mutable state outside of registered singletons.

### Package boundaries

- `pkg/` is the public API. Only add to `pkg/` what external consumers need. Do not expose `internal/` types directly.
- `internal/` packages must not import `pkg/` — the dependency goes one way.
- `internal/backend` does not exist in this repository — it lives in `nexus-product`. Do not recreate it here.
- New tools go in `internal/tools/<category>/`. New providers go in `internal/providers/`.

**Multi-agent packages** — respect the dependency direction (no cycles):

```
internal/agent    →  AgentProfile, ProfileRegistry (who agents are)
internal/mailbox  →  Message, Mailbox              (how they communicate)
internal/team     →  Dispatcher, TeamBus           (how the team is coordinated)
```

`internal/team` imports `agent` and `mailbox`. Neither `agent` nor `mailbox` imports `team`.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) and [`docs/team.md`](./docs/team.md) for the full package map.

### Adding a new tool

The tool tree under `internal/tools/` is organised by category:

| Directory | Contains |
|---|---|
| `bash/` | Shell execution, background tasks, monitor |
| `files/` | Read, write, edit, grep, glob, patch, fs |
| `math/` | Calculator, units, statistics, financial |
| `multimedia/` | generate_image, text_to_speech, speech_to_text |
| `notebook/` | Jupyter notebook + kernel tools |
| `social/` | Hacker News, dev.to (and planned: Reddit, Twitter…) |
| `agents/` | spawn_agent, wait_agent, list_agents, send_message, close |
| `special/` | LSP, FIM, RAG, memory, worktree, ask_user, plan, goal |
| `system/` | MCP, skills, nexusskill |
| `task/` | Task management (create/update/list/stop/get) |
| `web/` | browser, fetch, search |

**Steps to add a standalone tool:**

1. Create `internal/tools/<category>/<toolname>.go` (or a sub-package if the tool has >1 file).
2. Implement the `tool.Tool` interface (see [`docs/tools.md`](./docs/tools.md)).
3. Register in `internal/tools/builtin/builtin.go`.
4. Add to the built-in tools reference in `docs/tools.md`.
5. Write at least one test.

**Adding a tool to a consolidated package** (`multimedia/`, `bash/`, `agents/`): add a new `.go` file inside the existing package directory, then register the constructor in `builtin.go`. No new sub-directory needed.

### Adding a new provider

1. Add the provider constant to `internal/providers/registry.go`.
2. Implement or reuse a wire-format adapter in `internal/providers/adapter.go`.
3. Add model entries to the provider info table.
4. Add the env var to `docs/transports.md` and `docs/providers.md`.
5. Add golden tests in `internal/providers/adapter_test.go`.

### Commit messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`.

Examples:
```
feat(tools): add generate_image tool with OpenAI and Gemini providers
fix(providers): handle rate limit retry-after header in anthropic adapter
docs(sdk): document RuntimeEventFn callback and event types
```

Breaking changes: append `!` and add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## Testing

- Run `make test-race` before submitting — the race detector catches concurrency bugs.
- Tests must not make real API calls. Use mock providers or recorded fixtures.
- Security-sensitive code (sandbox, permissions) requires tests that assert the deny path, not just the allow path.
- Table-driven tests preferred for cases with multiple inputs.

---

## Pull request checklist

The **Gate CI check** runs automatically on every PR and must be green before merge. It covers:

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | `go build ./...` |
| Test (race detector) | `go test -race ./... -timeout 300s` |
| Format | `gofmt -l .` |
| Vet | `go vet ./...` |
| Lint | `golangci-lint run ./...` |

Before pushing, run locally:

```bash
make build
make test-race
gofmt -w .
go vet ./...
```

Additional review checklist:

- [ ] New code is covered by tests
- [ ] Public API changes are reflected in `docs/`
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] Breaking changes are called out in the PR description
- [ ] PR targets `dev`, not `main`

---

## What we will not merge

- Features that move `internal/backend` concerns into seshat (auth, users, orgs, billing).
- Provider-specific logic that bypasses the adapter interface.
- External HTTP calls in the main execution path without explicit user configuration.
- Changes that disable or weaken the permission system by default.
- New global mutable state.
- Code that uses `//nolint` without an explanation comment.
